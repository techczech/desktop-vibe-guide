simplify it and because right now and it just kind of like meandering through the landscape of this.

Kelly Webb-Davies

0 minutes 6 seconds0:06

Kelly Webb-Davies 0 minutes 6 seconds

But what are you without describing?

Dominik Lukes

0 minutes 10 seconds0:10

Dominik Lukes 0 minutes 10 seconds

Yeah.

Kelly Webb-Davies

0 minutes 10 seconds0:10

Kelly Webb-Davies 0 minutes 10 seconds

Without just grabbing the whole process, what tools are they though that you're looking at?

Dominik Lukes

0 minutes 13 seconds0:13

Dominik Lukes 0 minutes 13 seconds

So, so, so the thing that I, because I'm sort of switching between all of them, but the but but the thing that I will definitely want to show you is anti-gravity, because and that's what I'm showing Trish as well, and I I actually gonna I wanna sort of and there's and I was gonna make so my what I was going to.

Kelly Webb-Davies

0 minutes 19 seconds0:19

Kelly Webb-Davies 0 minutes 19 seconds

It.

Kelly Webb-Davies 0 minutes 23 seconds

Yeah, yeah.

Dominik Lukes

0 minutes 32 seconds0:32

Dominik Lukes 0 minutes 32 seconds

maybe suggest for you is to maybe use anti-gravity and take either your personas or your article or whatever it is and build an interactive website with them, like something that you can present it better. That will hopefully get you familiar with anti-gravity and some of the building blocks.

Dominik Lukes 0 minutes 55 seconds

And then once you're familiar with that, you can then take it forward to other places. Normally I would actually start you with Google AI Studio, but Google just made a bunch of updates to it and it's incredibly unstable. They just come there saying, we're going to make it better. So at the moment, Google AI Studio is just because of, I mean, it works, it's just like.

Kelly Webb-Davies

1 minute 2 seconds1:02

Kelly Webb-Davies 1 minute 2 seconds

Yeah.

Dominik Lukes

16 minutes 59 seconds16:59

Dominik Lukes 16 minutes 59 seconds

What it may also have to do as part of the plan execution, you might have to install things on your computer. Because in order, so let's say if you're like in Google AI Studio or Lovable or just any of these things, it will just basically runs on a server that has everything ready pre-installed for it. What you're trying to do is make your own computer into your own local server.

Dominik Lukes 17 minutes 22 seconds

that has all the right things a server needs to have for you to use it and to like to do all of these things and because basically most people don't gonna have those intuitions, but that server somewhere that's serving those websites is also a computer. I mean, it's kind of obvious, but people kind of think it was like mysterious thing that has to happen, but it's exactly the same thing. It's a computer like yours that has stuff installed on it.

Dominik Lukes 17 minutes 45 seconds

and shows it to other people. That's all that is. So, there's like no, there's nothing that's on a server somewhere that Google has or Amazon has that you couldn't run on your computer locally. So that's just like, that's, I think most people don't have that intuition. So if you, if you're one of them, that's, I think that's the important thing. Okay.

Kelly Webb-Davies

17 minutes 48 seconds17:48

Kelly Webb-Davies 17 minutes 48 seconds

Yeah.

Kelly Webb-Davies 17 minutes 58 seconds

Yeah.

Kelly Webb-Davies 18 minutes 4 seconds

Move that.

Dominik Lukes

18 minutes 6 seconds18:06

Dominik Lukes 18 minutes 6 seconds

All right, so what are we doing? It's still the, it's the, so one of the things, one of the reasons why sometimes why I will switch to Claude Code is to Claude rather, to Claude Opus, not Claude Code, Claude Opus, is because it's sometimes Gemini is a bit too eager to do things even in planning mode. So I think actually right now it's just gonna start, it's just kinda doing things and so, so that's that's the one.

Kelly Webb-Davies

18 minutes 23 seconds18:23

Kelly Webb-Davies 18 minutes 23 seconds

Yeah.

Kelly Webb-Davies 18 minutes 27 seconds

Yeah.

Dominik Lukes

18 minutes 31 seconds18:31

Dominik Lukes 18 minutes 31 seconds

You just scroll up and so basically, it's even decided, oh, you know what, I'm going to try images. Normally, so that's why I want to start at a very, very general level.

Kelly Webb-Davies

18 minutes 44 seconds18:44

Kelly Webb-Davies 18 minutes 44 seconds

Yeah, so yes, in Djenna.

Dominik Lukes

18 minutes 44 seconds18:44

Dominik Lukes 18 minutes 44 seconds

Uh, yeah, yeah, and so, so it's just gonna, and if you go to the implementation plan.

Kelly Webb-Davies

18 minutes 53 seconds18:53

Kelly Webb-Davies 18 minutes 53 seconds

Yeah, yeah.

Dominik Lukes

18 minutes 53 seconds18:53

Dominik Lukes 18 minutes 53 seconds

There's a tab at the top. You see the task, but there's also a plan, right? So this is actually started implementing, started implementing. So it's already done, just done stuff, right? And so, so that's not always what you want. So if I want a very sort of strict plan adherence, I would use Opus for that.

Kelly Webb-Davies

18 minutes 56 seconds18:56

Kelly Webb-Davies 18 minutes 56 seconds

Okay.

Kelly Webb-Davies 18 minutes 59 seconds

Ah.

Kelly Webb-Davies 19 minutes 12 seconds

Yeah.

Dominik Lukes

19 minutes 14 seconds19:14

Dominik Lukes 19 minutes 14 seconds

But the reason you don't want to use Opus for everything is because Opus is, you get higher usage limits on the Gemini models because they're Google's. So Opus, that's not, you know, they're basically paying Anthropic money to use their model.

Kelly Webb-Davies

19 minutes 14 seconds19:14

Kelly Webb-Davies 19 minutes 14 seconds

Yeah.

Dominik Lukes

19 minutes 34 seconds19:34

Dominik Lukes 19 minutes 34 seconds

The Opus one, which is why, you know, there's just kind of more limitations.

Kelly Webb-Davies

19 minutes 38 seconds19:38

Kelly Webb-Davies 19 minutes 38 seconds

Oh, so how am I how is Google, like what am I on for Flash at the moment, aren't I?

Dominik Lukes

19 minutes 43 seconds19:43

Dominik Lukes 19 minutes 43 seconds

There is, there is a, there is a setting now that you choose where you see the limits. I just use it until it runs out and it's just like, "You're cut off for an hour and it's okay, I'll come back in an hour, so, so I, I don't have a perfect, there's no easy way, because so, so just so that you understand what's happening right now, the agent is just like, there's enormous amounts of chats happening behind your back.

Kelly Webb-Davies

20 minutes 5 seconds20:05

Kelly Webb-Davies 20 minutes 5 seconds

Yes.

Kelly Webb-Davies 20 minutes 13 seconds

Yeah.

Dominik Lukes

20 minutes 14 seconds20:14

Dominik Lukes 20 minutes 14 seconds

If we can just now browse, you can see it's generating files, right? So you can click on any one of those. I mean, by and large, don't because unless you want to. I'm just going to show you, yeah, code is happening. And it's also, if you click on the images, it created a folder with images in it. So you can literally go click on that folder.

Kelly Webb-Davies

20 minutes 32 seconds20:32

Kelly Webb-Davies 20 minutes 32 seconds

Oh.

Kelly Webb-Davies 20 minutes 34 seconds

Oh yeah.

Dominik Lukes

20 minutes 35 seconds20:35

Dominik Lukes 20 minutes 35 seconds

And it shows the images it made. Right. Oh, so here's another thing. Don't close it. So that doesn't matter. But the other thing anti-gravity will do, it will.

Kelly Webb-Davies

20 minutes 37 seconds20:37

Kelly Webb-Davies 20 minutes 37 seconds

Ah, no, I don't want to open.

Kelly Webb-Davies 20 minutes 40 seconds

Oh, it's gone, sorry.

Kelly Webb-Davies 20 minutes 47 seconds

Oh, there it is.

Dominik Lukes

20 minutes 47 seconds20:47

Dominik Lukes 20 minutes 47 seconds

launch a browser and it will sort of look around what is created. So actually the agent right now, because you see a little blue border around that browser, that is anti-gravity browsing its own creation.

Kelly Webb-Davies

20 minutes 49 seconds20:49

Kelly Webb-Davies 20 minutes 49 seconds

The.

Kelly Webb-Davies 21 minutes

Ahh.

Dominik Lukes

21 minutes 2 seconds21:02

Dominik Lukes 21 minutes 2 seconds

Right.

Kelly Webb-Davies

21 minutes 3 seconds21:03

Kelly Webb-Davies 21 minutes 3 seconds

Yeah.

Dominik Lukes

21 minutes 5 seconds21:05

Dominik Lukes 21 minutes 5 seconds

And and that's what you got, right? So, so, so, so that's how easy, and it's not even finished because, as you can see, you see the red, the red square is still going on, so it's still working.

Kelly Webb-Davies

21 minutes 10 seconds21:10

Kelly Webb-Davies 21 minutes 10 seconds

Ohh.

Kelly Webb-Davies 21 minutes 19 seconds

Yeah.

Dominik Lukes

21 minutes 20 seconds21:20

Dominik Lukes 21 minutes 20 seconds

And.

Dominik Lukes 21 minutes 22 seconds

Is just just happening, right?

Kelly Webb-Davies

21 minutes 24 seconds21:24

Kelly Webb-Davies 21 minutes 24 seconds

Okay.

Dominik Lukes

21 minutes 26 seconds21:26

Dominik Lukes 21 minutes 26 seconds

and it actually took the easiest path.

Dominik Lukes 21 minutes 31 seconds

And just create a single HTML file.

Dominik Lukes 21 minutes 36 seconds

Uh, that you know, so, and so, so you could sort of...

Dominik Lukes 21 minutes 42 seconds

Uh, you could, you could just basically...

Dominik Lukes 21 minutes 45 seconds

Start.

Dominik Lukes 21 minutes 49 seconds

Start with with that, so you know, as you can see, just made a website. The one more, one thing you have to, the one thing these models are very, very, they're very much sort of a were trained on to please Anders because they do everything to default in dark mode. It's like a favorite, oh, I'll do, and so, so all you have to do is later just like don't like add a dark mode toggle or just make it light mode, so, so that that's like it.

Kelly Webb-Davies

22 minutes 6 seconds22:06

Kelly Webb-Davies 22 minutes 6 seconds

But.

Dominik Lukes

22 minutes 12 seconds22:12

Dominik Lukes 22 minutes 12 seconds

That's just like their default taste, what I would call, so like a like a tasteful thing.

Kelly Webb-Davies

22 minutes 15 seconds22:15

Kelly Webb-Davies 22 minutes 15 seconds

Yeah.

Dominik Lukes

22 minutes 20 seconds22:20

Dominik Lukes 22 minutes 20 seconds

And yeah, so that's in a way, if you so when I keep talking about agents and desktop agents, this is what it is, right? So all of a sudden you have an agent that can do all of these things.

Kelly Webb-Davies

22 minutes 28 seconds22:28

Kelly Webb-Davies 22 minutes 28 seconds

Yeah.

Kelly Webb-Davies 22 minutes 32 seconds

Yeah.

Dominik Lukes

22 minutes 35 seconds22:35

Dominik Lukes 22 minutes 35 seconds

So while it's doing that, one more thing you can do. So just let's go back to anti-gravity. It's going to happen in the background, doesn't need to be in the foreground. It's just like let it browse around. And one of the things you can do, you can work on more than one folder at a time, but you have to open a new window. So if you click on File, the menu at the top,

Kelly Webb-Davies

22 minutes 43 seconds22:43

Kelly Webb-Davies 22 minutes 43 seconds

Van.

Kelly Webb-Davies 22 minutes 47 seconds

OK.

Kelly Webb-Davies 22 minutes 50 seconds

Yeah.

Dominik Lukes

22 minutes 53 seconds22:53

Dominik Lukes 22 minutes 53 seconds

Say new window, there you go, and now you can open folder and so let's do the other party trick and just click open folder and let's open your downloads folder, assuming you don't. Great, so open it.

Kelly Webb-Davies

23 minutes 2 seconds23:02

Kelly Webb-Davies 23 minutes 2 seconds

Oh, no.

Kelly Webb-Davies 23 minutes 4 seconds

Mmh.

Kelly Webb-Davies 23 minutes 8 seconds

Oh.

Dominik Lukes

23 minutes 10 seconds23:10

Dominik Lukes 23 minutes 10 seconds

And this is where I would trust, again, if you just trust it, it's fine.

Dominik Lukes 23 minutes 16 seconds

Right, and so assuming you don't have anything in your, so are you using your downloads folder for just like just get random stuff or?

Kelly Webb-Davies

23 minutes 25 seconds23:25

Kelly Webb-Davies 23 minutes 25 seconds

Yeah, but I it's not as much in it as I usually is because I did like move it all up to my desktop a while ago.

Dominik Lukes

23 minutes 29 seconds23:29

Dominik Lukes 23 minutes 29 seconds

Right, right. OK, well, let's do that. So, so, so here's that's why I would switch to Obus.

Dominik Lukes 23 minutes 37 seconds

I mean, Gemini's fine, but it's just too eager recently, so I said that's why he's Opus is very good at sort of like following instructions and planning and not just rushing ahead and doing things right, and so, and Stephen, and just like help me organise my downloads folder.

Kelly Webb-Davies

23 minutes 46 seconds23:46

Kelly Webb-Davies 23 minutes 46 seconds

Yeah.

Kelly Webb-Davies 23 minutes 51 seconds

Here, so would you like help? Help us out of those.

Dominik Lukes

23 minutes 52 seconds23:52

Dominik Lukes 23 minutes 52 seconds

Yeah, just like it in.

Dominik Lukes 23 minutes 55 seconds

Help me organize, organize, doesn't matter. I just the particular just like.

Kelly Webb-Davies

23 minutes 58 seconds23:58

Kelly Webb-Davies 23 minutes 58 seconds

Yeah, I just didn't know, I didn't know if you said how or help. Help me with my... I can't type anymore now that I dictate everything.

Dominik Lukes

24 minutes 6 seconds24:06

Dominik Lukes 24 minutes 6 seconds

You can also dictate using that microphone in there, which is slightly different than the ChatGPT one, because often it comes to bloodbats line. Let's go, yeah, that's it.

Kelly Webb-Davies

24 minutes 8 seconds24:08

Kelly Webb-Davies 24 minutes 8 seconds

Fiona.

Kelly Webb-Davies 24 minutes 12 seconds

Yeah.

Kelly Webb-Davies 24 minutes 14 seconds

That's it.

Dominik Lukes

24 minutes 19 seconds24:19

Dominik Lukes 24 minutes 19 seconds

Right, so I have, I have had, I use for this, but you can use antigravity as well. I had to organise my everything, like all my folders, just like, to be honest, I've never unleashed it on OneDrive because I don't trust OneDrive because of the sort of OneDrive is always interfering with itself because of the constant syncing, but everything that isn't in OneDrive.

Dominik Lukes

1 hour 4 minutes 52 seconds1:04:52

Dominik Lukes 1 hour 4 minutes 52 seconds

And creativity, yeah, I know, I know this is pretty amazing, so I'm still amazed at it.

Kelly Webb-Davies

1 hour 4 minutes 55 seconds1:04:55

Kelly Webb-Davies 1 hour 4 minutes 55 seconds

Isn't AI gonna ruin our creativity?

Dominik Lukes

1 hour 4 minutes 58 seconds1:04:58

Dominik Lukes 1 hour 4 minutes 58 seconds

Gosh, yes, I know it's gonna doom us all.

Kelly Webb-Davies

1 hour 4 minutes 59 seconds1:04:59

Kelly Webb-Davies 1 hour 4 minutes 59 seconds

Yeah.

Kelly Webb-Davies 1 hour 5 minutes 2 seconds

He.

Kelly Webb-Davies 1 hour 5 minutes 3 seconds

So it's when I got actually when I got Sarah Ratner to look at the last version of the article and she went through and she was like, oh sorry, I rewrote like some of the bits and I was like, it's all right, I'm not tied to it because I didn't write the prose. It's fine. It says what I wanted to say, but I didn't actually write it.

Dominik Lukes

1 hour 5 minutes 3 seconds1:05:03

Dominik Lukes 1 hour 5 minutes 3 seconds

All right.

Dominik Lukes 1 hour 5 minutes 7 seconds

Mm.

Dominik Lukes 1 hour 5 minutes 17 seconds

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I, I think that's a, I mean, this will be a good case study of that.
