# Alternative AI Coding Agents

While we recommend beginning with **Antigravity** because it's free, easy to set up, and built directly into your development environment, there are other powerful AI agents you might want to explore as your needs grow.

There are not many fundamental differences between the various agents. They all have similar capabilities and limitations. Even their interfaces are usually similar. The main differences are in the details, such as the quality of the AI models used, specific features or interface preferences, and the price.

## 1. Antigravity (Google - Recommended for Starters)

**Pros**: 
* Free, easy setup, seamless integration with desktop workflows
* Uses Google's models but also has access to Claude models from Anthropic
* Full agentic capabilities: file editing, terminal commands, web browsing, deployment

**Cons**: 
* Might have limits on usage without paying
* New and less tried and tested tool compared to alternatives
* Smaller community and fewer tutorials available

**Best for**: Getting started with AI-powered development, learning the basics, experimenting without financial commitment.

## 2. Cursor

Cursor is a specialized coding application built from the ground up to be used with AI assistants—similar to Antigravity but with a more polished interface.

**Pros**:
* **Known entity**: Lots of guides and tutorials available
* **Many models**: You can use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI
* **Mature product**: Well-tested with a large user base
* **Excellent multi-file editing**: Superior context awareness across your codebase

**Cons**:
* **Cost**: Premium features require a monthly subscription ($20/month as of 2025)

**Best for**: Professional developers who want the best visual experience and are willing to pay for premium features.

## 3. Claude Code (Anthropic)

Claude Code is a command-line agent (running inside your terminal) created by Anthropic, the makers of the Claude AI models. (Extension for VS Code is also available).

**Pros**:
* **Speed**: Runs directly in your terminal, making it very fast for running commands and editing files
* **Agentic power**: Can autonomously manage files on your computer, run terminal commands, fix errors, and even search the web
* **Latest Claude models**: Always uses the most advanced Claude models available

**Cons**:
* **Cost**: Can get expensive—will run through usage limits quickly with heavy use
* **No UI**: Primarily works through a terminal interface, which might be less comfortable if you prefer a visual folder sidebar
* **Steeper learning curve**: Requires comfort with terminal-based workflows

**Best for**: Experienced developers or project managers comfortable in the terminal who want maximum autonomy and are willing to pay for powerful AI assistance.

## 4. Codex CLI

Codex CLI is a command-line agent (running inside your terminal) created by OpenAI, the makers of the Codex AI models. (Extension for VS Code is also available). It is similar to Claude Code but uses OpenAI's models.

**Pros**:
* **Speed**: Runs directly in your terminal, making it very fast for running commands and editing files
* **Agentic power**: Can autonomously manage files on your computer, run terminal commands, fix errors, and even search the web
* **Latest Codex models**: Always uses the most advanced Codex models available

**Cons**:
* **Cost**: Can get expensive—will run through usage limits quickly with heavy use
* **No UI**: Primarily works through a terminal interface, which might be less comfortable if you prefer a visual folder sidebar
* **Steeper learning curve**: Requires comfort with terminal-based workflows

**Best for**: Users of Claude Code who prefer OpenAI's models.

## 4. GitHub Copilot

GitHub's AI pair programmer, integrated directly into VS Code and other editors.

**Pros**:
* **Deep IDE integration**: Works seamlessly in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and more
* **Code completion**: Excellent at autocompleting code as you type
* **Large user base**: Widely adopted with extensive documentation

**Cons**:
* **Less agentic**: Primarily focused on code suggestions, not autonomous task execution but this is changing as new features are added.
* **Subscription required**: $10-20/month depending on plan
* **Limited to coding**: Not designed for general desktop productivity tasks

**Best for**: Developers who primarily want intelligent code completion within their existing IDE.

## 5. VS Code + Extensions (Cline, Continue, etc.)

Visual Studio Code with AI extensions like Cline or Continue. (And now Claude Code is also available as an extension for VS Code). 

**Pros**:
* **Free editor**: VS Code is free and widely used
* **Flexible**: Can use different AI providers and models
* **Familiar environment**: If you already use VS Code, no learning curve

**Cons**:
* **Requires setup**: Need to configure extensions and API keys
* **Variable quality**: Extension quality varies; some are less polished
* **Cost**: Still need to pay for AI API access

**Best for**: Developers who want to stay in VS Code and are comfortable with manual configuration.

**Note**:
 VS Code (made by Microsoft) is fully open source and both Cursor and Antigravity are modified versions of VS Code. This means (for example) that various plugins and extensions that work in VS Code will also work in Cursor and Antigravity.

## Which One Should I Use?

### If you want to get started immediately for free:
**Stick with Antigravity.** It's the easiest entry point and has full agentic capabilities.

### If you want the best visual experience and multi-file editing:
**Try Cursor.** It's worth the subscription if you're doing serious development work.

### If you are comfortable in the terminal and want maximum autonomy:
**Try Claude Code.** It's the most powerful for autonomous task execution.

### If you primarily want code completion in your existing IDE:
**Try GitHub Copilot** or **VS Code extensions.**

## Can I Use Multiple Agents?

Absolutely! Many developers use different tools for different tasks or even in parallel on the same project:
.
Each tool has its strengths. Start with one, then experiment with others as you become more comfortable.
